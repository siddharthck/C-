Problem ststement: from geeksforgeeks.org

Given a root of the tree you need to perform N AVL tree insertion operations on it. You need to complete the method insertToAVL
which takes 2 arguments the first is the root of the tree and the second is the value of the node to be inserted.The function
should return the root of the modified tree.


Note: Your code will be checked for each insertion and will produce an output 1 if all the nodes for a particular test case were correctly inserted else 0.

Input:


The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains
2 lines . The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the no of nodes to be inserted in the AVL tree and in
the next line are N space separated values denoting the values of the nodes to be inserted to the tree.



Output:


For each test case output will be 1 if the node was correctly inserted else 0.



Constraints:


1<=T<=100


1<=N<=100


Example(To be used only for expected output):


Input:

2

1 2

3

1 2 3

Output:
